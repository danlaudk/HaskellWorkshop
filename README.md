# Slides from Haskell workshops

Bryan O'Sullivan gave a 3-hour "intro to Haskell" workshop at the Strange Loop
conference, on September 18, 2011. These are the slides he used,
with a couple of post-workshop bugs fixed.

You can [read his slides online
here](http://bos.github.io/strange-loop-2011/slides/slides.html).

They're formatted from Markdown to HTML using John MacFarlane's
fabulous [pandoc tool](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).

I have translated the sheets to Dutch, and changed quite some things
to make them fit a series of workshops for colleques at Atos

Feel free to use them yourself, but if you do, please give attribution
to Bryan and me. Thanks!
